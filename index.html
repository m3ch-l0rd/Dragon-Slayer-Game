        Welcome to the town of Honey Wood young Hero. This is the town square. Honey Wood is peaceful place, you can visit our shop if your health is low, or if you are in search of a good weapon. I warn you young Hero
        a terrible dragon prevents our people from traveling across the mountain path. Would you be able to help us? Of course you may want to build your experience by fighting some lesser monsters that are known to live

			<h2 >About Dragon Slayer</h2>
			<p>The core concept of this project is from the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a> java script project "building a role playing game...". I thought this project was very cool
		, it inspired me to further develop the concept, and make a webpage for it. </p>
			<p>I used <a href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text2img">deepai</a> image generator to generate the pixel background and character images. Some story details were edited to make it more my own and create more context for the player.
			I plan to continue the development of this project and my coding skills.</p>
